# kmer-analysis
Analyze different features of k-mers 

Built with Python by Stella Trout

ORGANIZATION

The code is organized into three main folders. KmerGenRand contains code for trimming FASTAs and compiling frequency data and is the first k-mer analysis program I coded , whose functions all other programs in this project utilize. KmerMetrics contains code for analyzing specific features of k-mers in genes, such as the amount of a certain nucleotide a k-mer contains. OriginalImplementation contains the original code I used on my data set. I have tried to make all the programs as reusable as possible, but have included the original code so as to give the reader a suggestion as to how they might implement the functions themselves. I have also included the R scripts I wrote to process my code. These were highly specific to my data set and would be pointless to adapt and reuse, but they are present nevertheless to give the reader an idea of the way I processed my data.
