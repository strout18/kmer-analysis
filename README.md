# kmer-analysis
Analyze different features of k-mers 

Built with Python by Stella Trout

ORGANIZATION

The code is organized into three main folders. KmerGenRand contains code for trimming FASTAs and compiling frequency data and is the first k-mer analysis program I coded , whose functions all other programs in this project utilize. KmerMetrics contains code for analyzing specific features of k-mers in genes, such as the amount of a certain nucleotide a k-mer contains. OriginalImplementation contains the original code I used on my data set. I have tried to make all the programs as reusable as possible, but have included the original code so as to give the reader a suggestion as to how they might implement the functions themselves. The R scripts I used to create the main data table, part of which is available in SampleG2ETable.txt, are also in this folder. They are highly specific to my data table, but I included these as well to give the reader some idea of the methods with which I approached this project.
