BasicAnalysis.py - Finds which k-mers occur most frequently in down vs. upregulated genes and provides the input for NucContent and NucDiversity.py
NucContent.py - Finds the average # of a given nucleotide for a data set in up/downregulated genes.
NucDiversity.py - Finds how many k-mers are diverse in a data set, here diversity is defined by a k-mer having > 2 different kinds of nucleotide. 
ImportTrimProcess.py - Trims and processes input FASTA files and data tables from FPKMs.
